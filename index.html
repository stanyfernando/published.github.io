Running out of ways to cope As each passing day losing hope things don't
grip like an unstable rope I wish this was nothing but a dream I woke

My life''s losing colour What a flavourless summer Rolling myself inside
a gutter Things around me seem to flutter
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# A distant echo

O' life's cruel irony Need someone vitally Do you hear my vibrancy? My
head's all spirally

Like a thread through a Needle Across the ocean like a seagull Searching
for something gleeful Standing by myself in an upheaval

Such a hot cold feeling My heart feels like peeling I keep seeing yet no
meaning Should I bother breathing?

Scared by emptiness Life doesn't seems compendious This darkness I hold
seems plenteous I'm just tired of feeling tetchiness
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# a heartfelt elegy for unheard melodies

Haunted by memories I cannot ignore, A raven croaks through my broken
door. I sit here in this endless night, Staring at a broken kite.

From the depths beneath the starry skies, Listening to my sorrowful
cries. I hear an eerie call across the hall, 'Twas all the secrets I
tried to hide Behind the walls.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# as gravity holds me down

Had I been there to hear a tavern tale of an old ghost shriveled in
darkness?

Had I been there while it taunts me like an old wound that never healed?

Had I been there to snare it as it stood arrayed like a stain that never
left?

Had I been there to skein a better world with cleansing fire to - burn
away the lies?

Had I been there to wake up against a stray dream that - has passed me
by?

# balance of love which is exactly what love should be when it's full and resolved

I'm just an orphan Who's life's in torsion. A clueless foreman, with no
proportion

A sole soul Strolls as walls roll Alone at a toll Seeking control

I could cry my troubles away Expect a divine disposition at play To make
my sorrows stray This all seem naïveté
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# for now i drink no more

Above the darkened clouds every pile seem to burn up as an implacable
rage calls- upon my time for the sleep of death.

While I hold onto my beating heart an ailing stranger seeks my demise as
he knocks at my reeking doorstep desiring my last breath in exchange for
an early grave.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Hiding memories of you in the gaps of my wall

Just want to lay my head on your shoulder To stop feeling any colder My
heart burns like fever It chips away my soul like a beaver

Wish you were beside No way I could suffice What it feels like Here I
lie
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# His nerves gave away pt.&nbsp;2

I needed a friend To put this loneliness to an end I cannot pretend and
contend What more do I have to comprehend?

I know I'm broken and you're taken I'm not mistaken by this cursed
equation I'd prefer a reconciliation But I guess, I'm beyond your
consideration

Thanks for your time Everything's bitter as a lime If you were mine, I
would've served you like a hime
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# His nerves gave away

It's ok you're busy I'm sorry if it's all tizzy My blood's running fizzy
Making my ticker iffy

I feel shitty for being gritty I'm aware I'm dreary I know I'm broken
and you're taken I'm not mistaken by this cursed equation

It's never your fault My heart's been fraught Never mistake my feelings
for a grain of salt It's time that I exalt and lock up my vault
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# I don't want to suffer because I'm incapable of withstanding the heartbreak of love

Such a hardest drug to quit Such a frail thing to admit I didn't had to
commit Now everything feels shit

Broken into thousand pieces My capacity to love decreases Walking on hot
sand in every beaches This is painful than any other diseases

I'm not supposed to miss you Yearning for one last moment to kiss you I
wish you'd feel the same within you So much to say, shall I continue?

You flew off with my wings now I'm flightless Without you, my life seem
sightless Doesn't matter, talking about it is pointless But every second
with you were timeless.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# I fell in love with you not knowing what love really was.

Without you I feel incomplete Why everything feels obsolete? Want you
like a heart needs a beat How do I keep it discreet?

Oh my sweet disposition Sorry for the confession Can't stop this
obsession, Feels closest to heaven

Somewhere our souls tangled As our hearts wrangled, All my neurones
dangled Kiss me and show how the skies get angled.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# i look up to the stars when i think of love.

There's so much love cooped up inside I want to give away to someone who
needs it; than someone who deserves it.

It breaks my heart to know that none is worthy. I hope I come across
someone to show what I've treasured across my lonely life

I hope to show them how much they mean to me and what it feels like not
to be me; And sight see a world together in love
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# I miss sitting beside you on a starry night

My fear turned to ashes As your love detaches Would things go back to
taste like molasses? These aches left so many gashes Now leave me be, so
I can fill up these patches

Draining tears all day While your true love saunters you away My heart
turns grey Leaving myself to dismay

I wonder if there's any capacity for hope As I'm stranded on a slippery
slope I see something bright I'll have to lope Tell me if you were me,
will you cope?
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# I yearn the dead stars for something I don't deserve

When stars collide A lost spirit coincide When the angels cry A stale
heart comply

Across the battle of yore Is that you who soar? With a siren that could
end this war O'! my oar, I found ashore

As Sun goes down Darkness drown Moonlight above the ocean Prevail over
my emotion
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# infinite affair

We're breathing the same air As we caress each other's hair Couldn't get
enough of your glare What of this infinite affair?

I see you for I cannot see far Let's fly above the bright shining star
Your giggles are soothing like sound of guitar That makes my heart light
up like a cigar

Your eyes are proof why god exists Such a stare that elicits Swerving
through a precipice Our bond shall be an edifice
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# laid in mud

A cawing raven Soothing my soul I lay my head As this song end

Once a land that soared Menacing the glory it hoard A blight spread
across Way toward the horizon

A shade of darkness creeps upon slowly I feel something dread that is
holy

This must be my end as godsend; Suggesting that I follow this buggered
friend.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# life is not some stupid centrepiece on the side table of nothingness

Why do evenings fade? As darkness aid Why do sky seem vague? Each
forgotten decade

A feather in my wing as it clings Tastes like spring As new life begins

Smelling something sour At each passing hour came along gloomy shower to
scour me from the devourer.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# lurk all night if necessary

A meaningless centrepiece At the edge of a graveyard A blight wanders
innocent as the sunlight;

Glimmering in the distance Faint light paving a sentence to my own
damned execution against all allusion.

Though the day is young, The worst has happened; The blight has begun,
It taints my soul- leaving me unshaken.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Medieval Rat

Everything's the exact same Never different, losing my sane Feels like
all they do is put the blame Who am I kidding? it's all lame

So far my existence's been a shame Hope you won't mind me exclaim Won't
you do me a favour and claim Fair enough, there's goes again, my flame

My heart's been maimed So far I've tried to proclaim My end's not that
far off to aim It's time that I do it, since it seems fair game
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Mindless affair

Stars are burning Planets are turning Galaxies growing For you

How do I stop this feeling Everything's falling Turns are fading For you

I think the end is calling Phones are ringing Faxes are singing For you

Tunes are neighing Darkness is cascading Tides are rising For you

Souls are clashing Trails a blazing Skies burning For you

Help me I swear Hope you're aware Never prepare Mindless affair
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# once what was bright and impassive

I saw a face As shadows took my place It had no grace as there was no
trace

Surrounded by a vague mystery I sense a caliginous history I see myself
distally No sight of liberty

When day seemed night Exhausted, I alight Found shelter to reignite What
an unintentional oversight

Silhouette that haunt me Says it run out of ways to taunt me I asked,
don't you want me? It said, I daunt thee.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# one tear is enough

Leaves are falling Rivers are fading Deserts are flaming Skies are
flashing

While you wake beside him I keep wallowing all dim like an out of tune
hymn Should've I gone out on a limb?

Hole in the ocean floor There stands a door I open as it pour All lines
tend to blur

# plaguer of dreams

Echoes through the stillness Whispering secrets of an ancient lore A
mysterious faintest spark within us Carried across the winds as they
soared.

A peace is shattered by anguished cries, Fear grips tightly like a
poison in disguise, What was once quiet, now comes alive, Like a swan
stirring into a graceful stride.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# scrolling through our late night texts makes me miss you even more

When you broke my heart It stung like a thousand dart As you depart I've
run out of tears to blart

I don't know what I did wrong, I just hoped it would prolong Thinking of
you until dawn Limping away like a broken fawn

Nothing has no meaning I wish I was dreaming How do I cauterise this
bleeding? I'll bounce back by weeping
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
**\# Shell shock**\#

When we kissed for the first time My existence sublimed When our lips
entwined Our souls were aligned

When you hold me like you do All Stars turn blue As blood rush through A
cold heart renews

As the moment felt right Everything was out of sight As street lights
got bright It was a night, I recite
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# tavern tale told of an evening

I don't like where I go when I sleep. My own sea of tears where I weep.

I don't know where I am hiding in my own dream. I don't know if I am
running away from my own grief.

Following a rain As it blows away Familiar faces, Peculiar places

I find good nor bad But only a truth spread like fire that cleansed who
I once was.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# Telegram to a space-faring creature

Cosmos in your cataract Ride Stars on saddleback Spinning around like
humpback I need my heart back

Each atoms of ours Comets down showers Skies above the flowers Sifting
sand for hours

When I think of you, time moves slow Walls turn hollow As I started to
follow Found a way out of my wallow
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# tormenting screams of my forefathers

I walk on a thread made of ice Where every step was out of depth When
winds whisper nothing but lies It unsealed wounds we never wept

Preaching from afar in the cold Listening to stories that unfold Walking
a pavement made of time Rooting for unborn stars to align

Dreaming a world made of sand Holding a universe in my hand Whatever's
left were all damned connected by an infinite strand.
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# we've forgotten that we can decide to die if we detest living

My love isn't something new It never left, I never knew Stranded on a
ship with no crew With no land in view

I'm just a tired old man With a little no good life span Out of a plan,
I began to swam, to Japan.

It feels as if time was dead With little no food to be fed As hunger
began to spread Ocean foam turned into bread.

Upon reaching the beach all wet I conjure the moment I escaped death As
I rejoiced my love I wed With every remaining breath
 
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# sun came through the leaves, lit them up like it was on fire.

Trapped in my own decaying shell,
Wondering why dreams end in hell.
Stars scattered above in a haunting way,
Leave me to ponder what price I must pay.

Innocent eyes stare back, beyond my grasp,
Sighs of a sinister truth, shrouded in death:
"Press on," they whisper, "though darkness may rise,
For here we toil, through courage we thrive."

=============================================================================================================================================== 
# for whom the bell tolls

Alone I stand, my soul in despair,
As I face the abyss, the end so near,
And as the shadows enfold me tight,
I question if my journey was right.

What did I seek, what did I yearn,
In this barren land where hope does burn?
Was it fame, fortune, or earthly pleasure,
That led me to this dire, cursed treasure?

Or was it a thirst for knowledge and light,
A quest for truth amidst the endless night,
In this cruel world of darkness and pain,
A desire to break free from this mortal chain?

Alone I stand, my mind consumed,
As the final bell tolls, my fate assumed,
But still, I cling to one last shred,
That my journey had meaning, before reaper claims my soul 

=============================================================================================================================================== 
# what separates life from death?

Hushed murmurs reverberate
Through the dimly lit halls,
As if a wandering nightmare
Of boundless wealth enthralls.

Twisted and withered,
All treasures blackened by sin,
Lurking in the shadows,
Lost to the world within.

Echoes of a long-lost past,
Haunted whispers doleful,
Where once there shone a glimmer,
Now shadows forever cast.

=============================================================================================================================================== 
# i wear the chains i forged in life 

Upon the bough, echoes weep,
For the night is long, darkness blessed.
Verses sung that dared to know
Abandoned dreams as fate is sworn.

Joyful bells that haunt the halls,
Merryful chimes ‘neath the trees.
Snowflakes drift like solemn cries,
Casting shadows ode wintertide.

Melancholic symphony of lost destiny,
Spectral sighs through endless night.
A lonely maze leads future’s gaze,
Bleak and dark wintry night under
moonlit skies.
=============================================================================================================================================== 
# if there was a heaven for all the flowers that die?

unburdened under evening sun,
i lay, wonder tantalised
by your fleeting kiss
that tastes so sweet.

your breath upon my neck
sizzles across my skin,
through a bright night
and severe tides.

nestled in darkness,
filled with dissent and discord,
starlight bursts lie in my wake,
with naked wounds that remain,
deviant as my mortal stain.
